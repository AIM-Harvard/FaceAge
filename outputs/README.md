# Output

This folder stores a sample of the output from the FaceAge pipeline (`utk_hi-res_qa_res-raw.csv`). This CSV file was obtained by running the demo script `predict_folder_demo.py` (with the default configuration stored in `config_predict_folder_demo.yaml`), found under the `src/test` subdirectory.

The CSV file `utk_hi-res_qa_res-ext_data.csv` is an identical copy of the aforementioned that incorporates all the information needed to reproduce the first Extended Data figures. This CSV has been generated from the Google Colab Notebook [link to the notebook here?].
